<h1>Pointers, Arrays and Strings</h1>
<h2>You get a memory address, and you get a memory address. Everyone gets a memory address.</h2>

<h3>Learning objectives:</h3>

* What are pointer and how to use them.
* What are arrays and how to use them.
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays.
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them.
* Scope of variables.

<h2>C - Pointers, arrays and strings</h2>

**0-reset_to_98**: updates a pointers' value to 98. <br />
**1-swap**: swaps the value of two given integers. <br />
**2-strlen**: gets the length of a string. <br />
**3-puts**: prints a string to the standard output. <br />
**4-print_rev**: prints a string in reverse. <br />
**5-rev_string**: reverses a given string. <br />
**6-puts2**: prints every other character of a given string. <br />
**7-puts_half**: prints half of a given string. <br />
**8-print_array**: prints 'n' elements of a given array of integers. <br />
**9-strcpy**: copies the string including the terminatin null character to given buffer. <br />
**100-atoi**: converts a given string to an integer. <br />

<h2>C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings</h2>

**0-memset**: fills memory with a constant byte. <br />
**1-memcpy**: copies memory area. <br />
**2-strchr**: locates a character in a string. <br />
**3-strspn**: gets the length of a prefix substring. <br />
**4-strpbrk**: searches a string for any of a set of bytes. <br />
**5-strstr**: locates a substring. <br />
**7-print_chessboard**: prints an image of the Flying Spaghetti Monster almighty. <br />
**8-print_diagsum**: prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers. <br />

SOOO. I completely broke down betty for this project. :S So sorry for my messy code. Ident doesn't work.
