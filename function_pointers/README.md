<h3>As if regular pointers weren't confusing enough!</h3>

<h3>Learning objectives:</h3>

- Learn what they are and how to use them.
- What they exactly hold.
- Where does it point to in the virtual memory.

<h3>Function definitions:</h3>

- **1-array_iterator.c**: executes a function given as parameter on each element of an array.
- **2-int_index.c**: searches for an integer.
#### <ins>Task 4</ins>:
  - **3-main.c**: performs an arithmetic operation according to the given parameters.
  - **3-get_op_func.c**: selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user.
