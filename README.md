This is a introductory repository to begin working with the C programming language. Part of Holberton's introduction into Computer Science.

For this project, I'm using Vim as my main editor, for that purpose, I've made use of <a href="https://github.com/amix/vimrc">Amix's</a> Vim configuration.

Soooo I broke betty somewhere during my vim config, sorry for the messy code, she doesn't like indent. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
